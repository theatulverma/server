Framework Agnostic Zero Downtime Deployment with NGINX


Some frameworks have zero-downtime capacity built-in. Furthermore, at a larger scale, you'll want to roll out changes using more advanced routing and control mechanism. Still, for years, I've been using a simple nginx configuration trick when deploying web apps which I think is pretty useful.

The solution I use relies on alternating between two ports when deploying new code and having a short overlap between starting the new app and shutting down the existing one. The major downside is the doubling of resources for a brief period of time. At worse, you'll temporarily have twice the number of open connection to your DB, memory usage and so on.

First let's look at a basic configuration:

upstream webapp {
  server 127.0.0.1:9923;
  keepalive 32;
}

server {
  listen 80;

  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Connection "";

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://webapp;
  }
}
The simplest, and not very good solution, is to use the proxy_next_upstream directive and let nginx figure out which port our "webapp" is actually listening to:

upstream webapp {
  server 127.0.0.1:9923;
  server 127.0.0.1:9924; #ADDEDD
  keepalive 32;
}

server {
  listen 80;

  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Connection "";
  proxy_next_upstream error timeout; #ADDED
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://webapp;
  }
}
The problem with this approach is the performance hit we get whenever the unavailable upstream is picked. We can tweak the frequency of that via the server's fail_timeout property, but ultimately this solution feels half-assed.

The solution that I'm currently using is to define to upstream groups an rely on the backup attribute. First, the upstream definitions:

upstream webapp_9923 {
  server 127.0.0.1:9923;
  server 127.0.0.1:9924 backup;
  keepalive 32;
}
upstream webapp_9924 {
  server 127.0.0.1:9923 backup;
  server 127.0.0.1:9924
  keepalive 32;
}
We then setup our proxy pass to use whatever our app is currently configured to use:

{
  ...
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://webapp_9923;
  }
}
And, on deploy, we we switch from webapp_9923 to webapp_9924. This switching can happen in whatever tool you use to deploy, capistrano, fabric, whatever.

As a more concrete example, let's say we have a web app that has a configuration file at /opt/webapp/config.json which looks like:

{
  "listen": "127.0.0.1:9923",
  ....
}
You could use a bash script and sed to do the necessary configuration changes:

#!/bin/bash
CONFIG_FROM=127.0.0.1:9923
CONFOG_TO=127.0.0.1:9924
NGINX_FROM=http://webapp_9923
NGINX_TO=http://webapp_9924

# read our existing configuration file
# and see if we should swap our to <-> from
if grep --quiet 127.0.0.1:9924 /opt/webapp/config.json; then
  CONFIG_FROM=127.0.0.1:9924
  CONFIG_TO=127.0.0.1:9923
  NGINX_FROM=http://webapp_9924
  NGINX_TO=http://webapp_9923
fi

function rollback {
  sed -i "s#$CONFIG_TO#$CONFIG_FROM#g" /opt/webapp/config.json
}

sed -i "s#$CONFIG_FROM#$CONFIG_TO#g" /opt/webapp/config.json
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  exit 1
fi

sed -i "s#$NGINX_FROM#$NGINX_TO#g" /opt/nginx/sites-available/webapp
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  rollback
  exit 2
fi

## TODO: start a new web app

# wait for it to start
sleep 5

# reload nginx to use the now running & listening app
/etc/init.d/nginx reload

## TODO: stop the existing web app
For bonus points, since sed -i isn't portable, you could use perl -pi -e "s#$FROM#$TO#g" instead. Also, while NGINX should handle this well as-is, I normally shut down the currently running app by sending it a signal (SIGINT) which the app code catches and slowly shuts down. By slowy shutting down, I mean that, for a few seconds after receiving the signal, it'll keep answering requests but include a Connection: Close header in responses which should help clean up NGINX's keepalive connections.
